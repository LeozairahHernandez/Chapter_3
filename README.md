# Learning Dart Basics
Dart is a programming language that focuses on objects, has a structure based on classes, and uses a style similar to C. If you know languages like C#, C++, Swift, Kotlin, or Java/JavaScript, you can quickly start working with Dart. Itâ€™s easy to learn, and you can begin coding in no time. This chapter explained the basics of Dart. I found out how to add comments to my code to make it easier to read. I also learned about the main() function, which is what starts the app. I learned how to create variables to hold different types of information, like numbers, words, true/false values, lists, and others. I used a list to keep a collection of filters and learned how to go through each item in the list. I also learned about symbols that help with math, comparisons, logic, conditions, and a special way to call multiple actions on the same item, like changing its size and position.
